What is the difference between clone and pull?
Ans."Clone" and "pull" are both Git commands used to interact with remote repositories, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.
Clone:

Purpose: The git clone command is used to create a local copy of a remote Git repository. It's typically used when you want to start working on a project that you don't have a local copy of.

Usage: You typically run git clone followed by the URL of the remote repository you want to clone.
Effect: When you clone a repository, Git fetches all the files and commit history from the remote repository and creates a new local repository with the same history. It also sets up a remote reference to the original repository (usually named "origin").

Frequency: You typically use git clone once per project to set up your initial local copy.

Pull:

Purpose: The git pull command is used to update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository. It's used when you already have a local copy of a repository and want to bring it up to date with any new commits made by others.

Usage: You run git pull while inside your local repository. It fetches new changes from the remote repository and merges them into your current branch (by default).
Effect: git pull combines two operations: git fetch, which retrieves new changes from the remote repository, and git merge or git rebase, which incorporates those changes into your local branch.

Frequency: You use git pull as often as needed to update your local copy with the latest changes from the remote repository. It's a common operation in a collaborative development workflow.
