----------------------------------------------------------------- Collection Framework and Map Assignment --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===============================================================================================================================

1. What is the Collection framework in Java?
Ans:
The Java Collections Framework is a fundamental part of the Java programming language and provides a set of classes and interfaces for working with collections of objects. It is a standardized way to store and manipulate groups of objects, such as lists, sets, maps, and queues.

===============================================================================================================================

2. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
Ans:

Internal Data Structure:
ArrayList: 
It uses a dynamic array to store elements. When the array becomes full, it's resized to accommodate more elements.
LinkedList: 
It uses a doubly-linked list, where each element (node) contains a reference to the previous and next elements in the list.

Access Time:
ArrayList: 
Provides fast random access to elements because it uses an array. Accessing an element by index (get) is an O(1) operation.
LinkedList: 
Accessing elements by index is slower than in ArrayList, as it requires traversing the list from the beginning or end. It's an O(n) operation.

Insertion and Deletion:
ArrayList: 
Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of the list is slower because it may require shifting elements to accommodate the change. These operations are O(n).
LinkedList: 
Insertion and deletion of elements at any position are generally faster because you only need to adjust the links (pointers) between nodes. These operations are typically O(1) if you have references to the nodes to be inserted or deleted.

Memory Usage:
ArrayList: 
May use more memory than LinkedList because it has to allocate an array with a certain capacity, even if not all slots are used.
LinkedList: 
May use slightly less memory because it only allocates memory for the elements that are actually in the list, along with the overhead for maintaining the links.

Iteration:
ArrayList: 
Iterating through elements using a for-each loop or an iterator is efficient.
LinkedList: 
Iteration can be slower than ArrayList due to the additional overhead of following links.
==============================================================================================================================

3. What is the difference between Iterator and ListIterator?
Ans:

Collection Type:
Iterator: 
It is a more general-purpose interface and can be used to iterate over various types of collections, including lists, sets, and maps.
ListIterator: 
It is specific to lists, meaning you can only use it to iterate over elements in a list.

Direction of Iteration:
Iterator: 
It supports forward-only iteration. You can only move forward through the collection, from the beginning to the end. It does not have methods for backward traversal.
ListIterator: 
It allows bidirectional (forward and backward) iteration. You can traverse a list in both directions using ListIterator.

Methods:
Iterator: 
It provides methods like next(), hasNext(), and remove() for iterating forward and checking if there are more elements. It does not have methods for backward traversal.
ListIterator: 
In addition to the methods provided by Iterator, it offers methods like previous(), hasPrevious(), add(), and set() that allow you to traverse a list in both directions and perform more advanced operations, such as inserting and modifying elements during iteration.

Position:
Iterator: 
It doesn't maintain a current position. The iterator starts at the beginning of the collection, and you move it forward one element at a time using the next() method.
ListIterator: 
It maintains a current position within the list, so you can use methods like next() and previous() to move it forward and backward as needed.

==============================================================================================================================================

4. What is the difference between Iterator and Enumeration?
Ans:

Collection Type:
Iterator: 
It is a more modern and versatile interface introduced in Java 1.2 and is part of the Java Collections Framework. It can be used to iterate over various types of collections, including lists, sets, and maps.
Enumeration: 
It is an older interface, introduced in Java 1.0, and is not part of the Java Collections Framework. It is primarily used with legacy collections like Vector and Hashtable.

Direction of Iteration:
Iterator: 
It supports forward-only iteration. You can only move forward through the collection, from the beginning to the end. It does not have methods for backward traversal.
Enumeration: 
It also supports forward-only iteration. Like Iterator, you can only move forward through the collection.

Methods:
Iterator: 
It provides methods like next(), hasNext(), and remove() for iterating forward and checking if there are more elements. It does not have methods for backward traversal.
Enumeration: 
It provides methods like nextElement() and hasMoreElements() for forward traversal. It does not have a method for removing elements from the collection.

Concurrent Modification:
Iterator: 
It provides a remove() method that allows you to remove elements from the underlying collection during iteration safely. It also supports fail-fast behavior, meaning it detects concurrent modifications to the collection and throws a ConcurrentModificationException.
Enumeration: 
It does not provide a built-in mechanism for removing elements during iteration, and it does not detect concurrent modifications.

===============================================================================================================================

5. What is the difference between List and Set?
Ans:

Ordering:
List: 
A List is an ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Elements are stored in a specific sequence and can be accessed by their index. This means that the order in which you add elements to the list is maintained.
Set: 
A Set is an unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Elements are not stored in a specific sequence, and there is no concept of index or order.

Duplicates:
List: 
Allows duplicate elements. You can have multiple occurrences of the same element in a list.
Set: 
Does not allow duplicate elements. If you attempt to add the same element more than once, it will only be stored once in the set.

Accessing Elements:
List: 
You can access elements in a List by their index (position). It provides methods like get(int index) for this purpose.
Set: 
There is no direct way to access elements by index in a Set since it's unordered. You typically iterate through the set to access its elements.


==============================================================================================================================================

6. What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?
Ans:

Underlying Data Structure:
HashSet: 
It uses a hash table as the underlying data structure. This means that elements are stored based on their hash codes, which allows for fast access and insertion. As a result, the elements in a HashSet are unordered.
TreeSet: 
It uses a Red-Black Tree as the underlying data structure. This tree structure enforces a natural ordering of elements (or an ordering defined by a Comparator). Consequently, the elements in a TreeSet are sorted in ascending order.

Ordering:
HashSet: 
Elements in a HashSet have no specific order. They are arranged based on their hash codes and do not follow any particular sequence.
TreeSet: 
Elements in a TreeSet are sorted in ascending order according to their natural order (determined by the element type's Comparable implementation) or a custom ordering defined by a Comparator.

Duplicates:
HashSet: 
Does not allow duplicate elements. If you attempt to add the same element more than once, it will be stored only once.
TreeSet: Also does not allow duplicate elements. It enforces uniqueness based on the ordering criteria.

Performance:
HashSet: 
Offers constant-time (O(1)) average-case performance for common operations like adding, removing, and checking for element existence. It's usually faster for these operations than TreeSet.
TreeSet: 
Offers O(log n) average-case performance for common operations, where "n" is the number of elements. It's relatively slower than HashSet for these operations but is advantageous when you need elements in a specific order.

Iterating Elements:
HashSet: 
The iteration order is not guaranteed and does not follow any specific pattern. You can use an iterator or a for-each loop to iterate through the elements.
TreeSet: 
Iteration is in ascending order. You can use an iterator to traverse elements from the smallest to the largest or use a reverse iterator to traverse in reverse order.

Custom Ordering:
HashSet: 
You cannot define a custom ordering for elements. Elements are ordered based on their hash codes and are suitable for cases where order doesn't matter.
TreeSet: 
You can provide a custom Comparator to define the order of elements, making it flexible for cases where you need a specific sorting criteria.

==============================================================================================================================================

7. What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Ans:

Data Type:
Array: 
Arrays can hold elements of primitive data types (e.g., int, char) and objects. The size of an array is fixed when it is created, and it cannot be changed.
ArrayList: 
ArrayList is a part of the Java Collections Framework and can only hold objects (not primitives). It is a dynamic data structure, meaning its size can be adjusted as elements are added or removed.

Size:
Array: 
Has a fixed size that is determined when the array is created. If you need to change the size of an array, you must create a new array and copy the elements from the old array to the new one.
ArrayList: 
Resizes automatically as elements are added or removed. You don't need to worry about the initial size, and it can grow dynamically.

Performance:
Array: 
Generally has better performance for simple element access and iteration because it uses contiguous memory. Accessing an element in an array by its index is an O(1) operation.
ArrayList: 
While ArrayList provides dynamic sizing, it may have some overhead in comparison to arrays due to its use of an underlying array. Accessing elements by index is also an O(1) operation in most cases

Flexibility:
Array: 
Offers less flexibility because of its fixed size. If you need to change the size, you have to create a new array and copy elements.
ArrayList: 
Offers more flexibility as it can grow and shrink dynamically. It is easier to work with when the size of the collection is uncertain.

Primitives vs. Objects:
Array: 
Can hold elements of both primitive data types (e.g., int, char) and objects. For primitive types, you need to declare the array with the specific type (e.g., int[]) and the size.
ArrayList: 
Can only hold objects, not primitive data types. For primitive types, you need to use wrapper classes (e.g., Integer, Character) to store them in an ArrayList.

API and Features:
Array: 
Provides basic functionality for accessing, setting, and iterating through elements. It does not have the rich set of methods available in the Java Collections Framework.
ArrayList: 
Offers a wide range of methods and features, such as adding, removing, searching, sorting, and more, thanks to its integration with the Collections Framework.

==============================================================================================================================================

8. What is a Map in Java?
Ans:
In Java, a Map is an interface that is part of the Java Collections Framework and is used to represent a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a map is associated with a specific value, and you can use the key to look up and retrieve the associated value quickly

===============================================================================================================================

9. What are the commonly used implementations of Map in Java?
Ans:
HashMap , TreeMap LinkedHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap
==============================================================================================================================================

10. What is the difference between HashMap and TreeMap?
Ans:

Underlying Data Structure:
HashMap: 
It uses a hash table as the underlying data structure to store key-value pairs. Hashing allows for fast average-case performance for common operations like inserting, retrieving, and deleting elements. The order of elements in a HashMap is not guaranteed and can be arbitrary.
TreeMap: 
It uses a Red-Black Tree as the underlying data structure to maintain the key-value pairs in sorted order. This ensures that elements in a TreeMap are sorted according to the natural order (determined by the key's Comparable implementation) or a custom ordering defined by a Comparator.

Ordering:
HashMap: 
Elements in a HashMap are not sorted, and there is no specific order guaranteed. The order in which elements are stored may change over time.
TreeMap: 
Elements in a TreeMap are always sorted in ascending order based on the keys. This allows for range queries and efficient operations requiring a specific order.

Performance:
HashMap: 
Offers constant-time (O(1)) average-case performance for common operations like adding, retrieving, and deleting elements. It is generally faster than TreeMap for these operations.
TreeMap: 
Provides O(log n) average-case performance for common operations, where "n" is the number of elements. While it is not as fast as HashMap for individual operations, it excels in maintaining elements in sorted order.

Duplicates
HashMap: 
Allows only one null key but permits multiple null values. It does not allow duplicate keys (each key must be unique).
TreeMap: 
Does not allow duplicate keys, but it can have duplicate values. Keys are unique and are used to establish order.

Iterating Elements:
HashMap: 
The iteration order of elements is not guaranteed and can be arbitrary. You can use an iterator or for-each loop to iterate through the elements.
TreeMap: 
Elements are guaranteed to be iterated in ascending order based on the keys. This makes it suitable for tasks requiring sorted traversal.

Custom Ordering:
HashMap: 
Does not support custom ordering because it uses hash codes for storing elements.
TreeMap: 
Allows you to provide a custom Comparator to define the order of elements. This makes it flexible for defining custom sorting criteria

==============================================================================================================================================

11. How do you check if a key exists in a Map in Java?
Ans:
In Java, you can check if a key exists in a Map by using the containsKey(Object key) method. This method is defined in the Map interface, and it is implemented by all classes that implement the Map interface, such as HashMap, TreeMap, and others.

Here's how you can use the containsKey method to check if a key exists in a Map:

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a HashMap
        Map<String, Integer> ageMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Add key-value pairs to the map
        ageMap.put("Alice", 28);
        ageMap.put("Bob", 34);
        ageMap.put("Charlie", 22);

        // Check if a key exists
        String nameToCheck = "Alice";
        if (ageMap.containsKey(nameToCheck)) {
            System.out.println(nameToCheck + " exists in the map.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(nameToCheck + " does not exist in the map.");
        }
    }
}
